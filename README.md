**COVID-19 Data Analysis with SQL**

_Project Overview_

This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data using SQL queries to extract meaningful insights. The dataset includes information about confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries across various states and regions. Through basic to advanced SQL queries, we explore trends, calculate recovery and death rates, and identify key patterns in the pandemic data.

_Dataset Description_

The dataset includes the following columns:

State: The state where data is recorded.

Region: Geographical region of the state.

Confirmed: Number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.

Deaths: Number of deaths due to COVID-19.

Recovered: Number of recoveries.


_Key SQL Queries_

Basic Queries: Filtering by state, calculating total confirmed cases, and sorting by deaths.

Intermediate Queries: Grouping by regions, calculating death rates, and identifying high-risk areas.

Advanced Queries: Rolling averages, ranking states by recovery rates, and analyzing active cases.


_Project Highlights_

Active Cases Calculation

Death Rate and Recovery Rate Analysis

Region-Wise Insights and Trends


_Conclusion_

This project demonstrates the use of SQL for real-world data analysis, with a focus on extracting insights from COVID-19 statistics. The queries provide a solid foundation for analyzing large datasets and generating meaningful conclusions.

How to Run

1. Import the dataset into your SQL database.
